# esnext

Reference code for a course on ESNext.

The three exercises are:

1. _arrays_: shows how we can write more declarative, readable, predictable and testable code through array methods.
2. _currying_: shows functions as first-class citizens and how we can improve power and performance in our code using currying.
3. _composition_: shows the `compose` function as a powerful tool to combine together functions that have the same signature.
